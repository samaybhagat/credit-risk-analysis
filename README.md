# Portfolio-Optimizer

#### There's so many questions to ponder when beginning to invest. 

#### What are the right assets to select? How can you be sure you'll break a profit? What if you end up incurring massive losses? Money isn't something we can easily play around with.

#### Quantum Technology, however, makes things a lot less risky. 

## Developing a Quantum Portfolio Optimizer

#### With reference to IBM's Qiskit Finance resources, I built a VQE-driven portfolio optimizer that produces randomly generated data and provides the user with the optimal asset selection.

#### The world is finance is rapidly changing. The needs and wants of consumers are adjusting just as fast, and today's financial institutions aren't adapting at a pace that can keep up with this. 

#### One can only imagine, however, what the future will look like as the intersection between quantum and finance becomes increasingly apparently. If you're interested in learning more about this intersection, take a look at my code!
